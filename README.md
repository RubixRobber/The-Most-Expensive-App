# The-Most-Expensive-App

This is a really simple app inspired by the app *I am Rich*. In the app *I am Rich*, basically it was only a picture of a diamond. Still, the developer sold it for $1000 on the app store.
Because 8 people bought it, he made $8000 by doing basically nothing. My app is basically the same thing, but instead I give 10% of whatever I get to charity.
